## Introduction

The TENG Sensor Mat Project aims to create an energy-efficient sensor mat that can detect and identify individuals based on their stepping patterns. Utilizing the principles of triboelectricity, the mat generates a voltage signal when stepped on. This signal is then transmitted via BLE to a mobile app for real-time analysis and identification.

## Features

- **Low Power Consumption**: This project aims to make the sensor last a significant time with a single charge.
- **BLE Communication**: Sends data wirelessly to a mobile app using Bluetooth Low Energy.
- **Mobile App Integration**: A companion app to visualize data and identify users.

## Components

- **TENG Sensor Mat**: The main component that generates voltage when stepped on.
- **Battery**: Powers the TENG sensor mat and the microcontroller.
- **Microcontroller**: Processes the voltage signal and manages BLE communication.

## Software

1. **Mobile App**: 
   - Download and install the companion mobile app.
   - Pair the app with the BLE module following the on-screen instructions.
